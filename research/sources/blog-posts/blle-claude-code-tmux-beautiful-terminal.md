# Claude Code + tmux: The Ultimate Terminal Workflow for AI Development

**Author:** Not specified in article
**Source:** Blue Leaf blog

## Article Summary

This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to combine Claude Code with tmux to create a powerful, persistent development environment. The article emphasizes that "Persistent Sessions That Never Die" is tmux's "killer feature" when paired with Claude Code, allowing developers to resume work after disconnections without losing context.

## Key Advantages Highlighted

The guide outlines five primary benefits:

1. **Session Persistence** - Work continues running on servers even after disconnection
2. **Background Workflows** - Long-running tasks operate without blocking other work
3. **Multi-Pane Development** - Split terminals enable simultaneous monitoring of logs, tests, and resources
4. **Slash Commands** - Claude's commands like `/commit`, `/search`, and `/review` function seamlessly
5. **Remote Development** - Access your entire development environment from anywhere

## Configuration Details

The article provides a complete tmux configuration using the Catppuccin Mocha color scheme, featuring:

- True 24-bit color support
- Vim-style pane navigation (h/j/k/l keys)
- Customized status bar with session and system information
- UTF-8 support for Claude's formatted responses
- Increased history limits (10,000-50,000 lines)

## Practical Workflows

The guide includes scripts for:
- Creating multi-window development dashboards
- Managing separate sessions for different projects
- Monitoring long-running tasks
- Enabling collaborative pair programming

## Performance Claims

The author asserts this setup eliminates context loss, enables parallel operations, improves resource efficiency, survives network issues, and reduces startup time through persistent sessions.
