Subject: jadecli-ai: Building Team Agents SDK with Claude - Startup Program Application

Hi Anthropic Startup Program Team,

We're jadecli-ai, building a Team Agents SDK, a multi-agent orchestration framework specifically designed for Claude Code. We’re currently in early development, focused on building the core SDK that allows developers to easily create and manage teams of Claude-powered agents for complex tasks.

Our tech stack leverages the Claude API (Opus and Sonnet models), Python, TypeScript, FastMCP, and Redis. Our core use case directly benefits from Claude's strengths: we're using it for agent team coordination, task management, and automating software development workflows. We believe Opus and Sonnet are uniquely suited to handle the nuanced communication and reasoning required for effective multi-agent collaboration.

While early, we're seeing strong interest in our pre-release version, with several early adopters building POCs. We believe the $100K in API credits would be instrumental in allowing us to scale our testing and refine the SDK, directly improving the experience for our users. We understand VC-backed AI startups with traction are a key focus, and while we are currently bootstrapping, we are actively in conversation with several venture firms and believe this program would give us a major boost.

We’re excited about the potential of Claude and how it can power the next generation of AI agents. We'd love to discuss how the Startup Program can help us accelerate our development.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Founder, jadecli-ai
