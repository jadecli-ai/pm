jadecli-ai: Building Multi-Agent Orchestration for Claude Code

EMAIL BODY:
Hi Vercel Team,

We're jadecli-ai, building Team Agents SDK—a multi-agent orchestration framework that turns Claude Code into a collaborative development environment. Think "GitHub Copilot meets agent teams": we enable developers to spawn, coordinate, and manage multiple Claude agents (Opus for architecture, Sonnet for implementation, Haiku for testing) working together on complex software projects.

**What we've built so far:**
- Multi-agent task queue with Redis-backed coordination
- Real-time agent communication via FastMCP
- 6-pane WezTerm grid for parallel agent visualization
- PM system with VP Product → SDM → Staff Engineer hierarchy (agents managing agents)
- Working prototype coordinating 8+ concurrent agents on real codebases

**Why Vercel:**
We need to deploy:
1. **Agent Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of agent teams, task flows, and token usage (Next.js + React)
2. **API Gateway**: Serverless functions handling agent-to-agent communication, webhook routing, and Claude API proxying
3. **Documentation Site**: Interactive docs with live agent examples
4. **Marketplace**: Public registry for shareable agent workflows

Vercel's Edge Network + Serverless Functions are perfect for handling unpredictable agent workloads—we've seen bursts of 50+ API calls/second during parallel agent research tasks. The $100K in credits would let us scale from prototype to production-ready platform.

We're technical founders (ex-FAANG engineers) committed to the 6-week program and eager to showcase how Vercel powers the next generation of AI development tools.

Best regards,
The jadecli-ai Team
