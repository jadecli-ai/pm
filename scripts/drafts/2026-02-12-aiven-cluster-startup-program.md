Subject: jadecli-ai Application: Supercharging Agent Teams with Aiven

Hi Aiven Team,

We're jadecli-ai, and we're building the Team Agents SDK: a multi-agent orchestration framework specifically designed for Claude Code. Think of it as giving Claude-powered agents the ability to truly collaborate on complex tasks.

We're in early development, focused on building a robust core SDK using Claude API (Opus/Sonnet), Python, TypeScript, FastMCP, and Redis. Critically, we need a reliable, performant data layer for agent state caching, task queue management, and real-time coordination between distributed agents – and that's where Aiven comes in. We envision using Dragonfly/Redis on Aiven to ensure low-latency communication and efficient task processing across our agent teams. This is crucial for achieving the kind of dynamic, responsive behavior our users will expect.

We're a VC-affiliated (name of affiliated VC would go here if applicable, otherwise remove) pre-seed startup, well within the eligibility criteria for your Cluster Startup Program. Our team has deep expertise in AI and agent technologies, and we're confident that Aiven will be a vital component in scaling our infrastructure.

We'd love to discuss our use case in more detail. We're eager to apply and see how Aiven can help us bring truly collaborative AI agents to life.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
Co-founder, jadecli-ai
