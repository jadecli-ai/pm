Subject: Sentry for Reliable Agent Team Deployments at jadecli-ai

Hi Sentry Startup Program Team,

I'm [Your Name], a technical founder at jadecli-ai. We're building a Team Agents SDK - a multi-agent orchestration framework specifically designed for Claude Code. We're in early development, focused on solidifying our core SDK features with Python and TypeScript, leveraging the Claude API, FastMCP and Redis.

We’re eager to apply for the Sentry Startup Program. As we move towards production deployments of agent teams, reliable error tracking is paramount. Our agents will be distributed and complex, and we anticipate needing to monitor agent failures, API errors (especially Claude's rate limits!), and overall system health. Sentry seems ideal for providing the necessary visibility across this distributed architecture.

Given we're under 2 years old, have raised no funding, and are new to Sentry, we believe we meet your eligibility requirements. We're particularly excited about using the $5K in credits to proactively identify and resolve issues, ensuring smooth operation of our SDK and helping our users build reliable agent-based applications.

We're confident Sentry will be a valuable tool for us. Could you please let us know if you require any further information from us?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Founder, jadecli-ai
