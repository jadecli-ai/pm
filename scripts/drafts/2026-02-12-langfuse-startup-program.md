Subject: Langfuse for Debugging Complex Agent Orchestration at jadecli-ai

Hi Langfuse Startup Program Team,

We're jadecli-ai, building the Team Agents SDK: a multi-agent orchestration framework specifically designed for Claude Code. Think of it as infrastructure for building complex, cooperative AI agents.

We're currently in early development, focused on solidifying the core SDK using Claude API (Opus/Sonnet), Python, TypeScript, FastMCP, and Redis. A *critical* part of our workflow is debugging these multi-agent conversations and task flows. That's where Langfuse comes in. We plan to use Langfuse for comprehensive LLM observability, tracking agent performance metrics, token usage across multiple agents, and visualizing the complex conversation flows inherent in our multi-agent systems. This level of observability is essential for iterating quickly and delivering a robust SDK.

As a bootstrapped startup in our first year, we fit the eligibility criteria perfectly. We're genuinely excited about integrating Langfuse early on.

Would love to chat more about how we can leverage Langfuse to build the next generation of AI agents.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Founder, jadecli-ai
