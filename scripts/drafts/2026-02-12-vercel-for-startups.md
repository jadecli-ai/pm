Subject: jadecli-ai - Requesting Vercel for Startups Access

Hi Vercel Team,

I'm [Your Name], founder of jadecli-ai. We're building a multi-agent orchestration framework called Team Agents SDK, specifically designed to leverage the power of Claude Code for complex workflow automation. Think of it as a system for easily coordinating multiple AI agents working collaboratively.

We're currently in early development, focusing on building a robust and well-documented SDK based on the Claude API (Opus/Sonnet), Python, TypeScript, FastMCP, and Redis. We believe Vercel's serverless platform is perfectly suited for deploying our agent dashboard UI and documentation site. We also plan to use serverless functions for handling webhooks and creating an API proxy.

As an early-stage startup, the $600 in credits from the "For Startups" program would be a huge help in accelerating our development. We're confident Vercel's platform will provide the reliability and scalability we need as we grow.

We’re excited to explore the full potential of Vercel for our project. Can we discuss the application further?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Founder, jadecli-ai
