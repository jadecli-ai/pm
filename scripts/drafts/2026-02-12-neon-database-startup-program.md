Subject: Neon Database for Scalable Agent Team Orchestration at jadecli-ai

Hi Neon Startup Program Team,

We're jadecli-ai, building a multi-agent orchestration framework called Team Agents SDK specifically for Claude Code. We're in early development, focused on creating a robust SDK that simplifies the creation of cooperative agent teams.

Our tech stack includes Claude API (Opus/Sonnet), Python, TypeScript, FastMCP, and Redis. A critical piece for us is scalable persistence for agent state, task queues, and overall orchestration metadata. That's why we're so excited about Neon. As we scale the number of agents within teams, we need a serverless Postgres solution that can handle the load without us having to manage infrastructure.

We're eligible for the startup program – we’re a VC-backed company, have raised under $5M, and are less than 12 months old.

We believe Neon's ability to provide a serverless Postgres environment, perfectly fits our use case to store agent teams information. We're eager to leverage the $100K credits to build a solid foundation for Team Agents SDK, and the benefits of a fully managed system that would allow us to concentrate on the core SDK.

We'd love to discuss our specific needs and how Neon can help us scale. We've submitted our application via [https://neon.com/startups].

Best regards,
[Your Name/Founder Name]
